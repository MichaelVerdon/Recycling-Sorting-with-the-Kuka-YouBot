# Recycling-Sorting-with-the-Kuka-YouBot
V-Rep simulation of a mobile gripper arm robot sorting objects.
This project was done to summarise my robotics module in my third year of university. (Achieved 95% :))) )

Some code was borrowed from the KukaYouBot and Hanoi Tower example.

All Written in LUA.
